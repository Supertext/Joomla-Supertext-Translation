# Supertext Translation for Joomla

Translate Joomla articles into your site's other languages with **Supertext AI**, straight from the Articles list or the article editor.

Select articles, click **Supertext**, tick the languages and click **Translate**. The plugin translates each article and saves the result as a linked translation (Joomla's *Multilingual Associations*), unpublished, so an editor can review it before it goes live.

- Works with Joomla's own multilingual setup: content languages and associations
- Translates title, article text (formatting, links and lists are kept), meta description and keywords, image alt texts and captions, link labels, and Text/Textarea/Editor custom fields
- Leaves plugin tags such as `{loadmodule …}` untouched
- Overwrites existing translations only when you ask for it, with a clear warning first
- Formal or informal tone and custom Supertext language codes per language
- Also available on the command line: `php cli/joomla.php supertext:translate`
