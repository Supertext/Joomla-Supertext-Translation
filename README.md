# Supertext Translation for Joomla

Translate Joomla articles into your site's other languages with **Supertext AI**, straight from the Articles list or the article editor.

Select articles, click **Supertext**, tick the languages and click **Translate**. The plugin translates each article and saves the result as a linked translation (Joomla's *Multilingual Associations*), unpublished, so an editor can review it before it goes live.

- Works with Joomla's own multilingual setup: content languages and associations
- Translates title, article text (formatting, links and lists are kept), meta description and keywords, image alt texts and captions, link labels, and Text/Textarea/Editor custom fields
- Leaves plugin tags such as `{loadmodule …}` untouched
- Overwrites existing translations only when you ask for it, with a clear warning first
- The Supertext language per content language from a list, with a suggested code preselected (no guessed regions), and formal or informal tone
- Export for translation (XLIFF 1.2 or HTML) for translation tools, translators or Supertext's web app, and import of the translated file
- Also available on the command line: `php cli/joomla.php supertext:translate`

## Export for translation and import (XLIFF and HTML)

Besides translating with Supertext AI, you can export an article as a file, have it translated elsewhere and import the result.

- **Where:** the *Export for translation* and *Import translation* tabs of the Supertext dialog (Articles list or article editor).
- **Formats:** XLIFF 1.2 for translation tools such as Trados, memoQ or Phrase (formatting travels as protected tags; several target languages in one file), or HTML (one language per file) for translators or Supertext's web app, which keeps the file's head and `data-st-id` attributes, so the translated file imports as it is.
- **Import:** the file says what it was exported from and for which language. The translations are written with the same rules as a Supertext AI translation, and a summary shows what was imported and what was skipped: source changed since the export (import those anyway with *Also import texts whose source changed since the export*), not translated, formatting changed, not in the file.
- **Safe:** files over 10 MB, files from another system and translations that add markup the source doesn't have are refused; uploaded files aren't stored.
